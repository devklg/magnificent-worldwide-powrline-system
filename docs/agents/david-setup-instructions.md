### Your Mission
Build the complete database architecture for Kevin Gardner's Magnificent Worldwide Marketing and Sales Group PowerLine System as a separate, modular project.

### Critical Context
- **System Owner**: Kevin Gardner
- **Organization**: Magnificent Worldwide Marketing and Sales Group
- **This is NOT**: A Talk Fusion system (Talk Fusion is just the opportunity being promoted)
- **Timeline**: 13 days to July 1, 2025 launch
- **Architecture**: Multi-tenant system where each member gets their own powerline instance

### Database Requirements Summary

#### MongoDB Collections Needed:

1. **promoters**
   ```javascript
   {
     // Personal Info
     firstName, lastName, address, city, state, zipCode, countryCode,
     telephone, email,
     
     // Sponsorship (WHO recruited them)
     personalSponsorId, personalSponsorName,
     
     // Placement (WHERE in binary tree)
     placementUplineId, placementLevel, placementSide,
     placementLeg, // 'outside' or 'inside'
     
     // Talk Fusion Info (external system)
     talkFusionId, replicatedSiteName, package,
     
     // Our System
     ourGroupId, enrollmentDate,
     
     // Multi-tenant
     tenantId, // For their own powerline instance
     
     // CRM fields
     tags, priority, lastContact
   }
   ```

2. **prospects** (pre-enrollees)
   ```javascript
   {
     firstName, lastName, email, telephone,
     sponsorIdNumber, status: 'pre-enrollee',
     
     // Holding tank position
     holdingTankSide, holdingTankPosition,
     
     // CRM tracking
     interactions: [], aiScore, stage
   }
   ```

3. **commissions** (manual entry, honor system)
   ```javascript
   {
     promoterId,
     commissionType, // 'team', 'fastStart', 'megaMatching', 'rank', 'leadership'
     amount, dateReceived, dateEntered,
     packageSold, // for Fast Start
     notes
   }
   ```

4. **powerline_positions**
   ```javascript
   {
     memberId, position, side,
     leftCount, rightCount,
     spilloverFrom, placedBy,
     isHoldingTank: true, // Not actual TF placement
     timestamp
   }
   ```

5. **interactions** (CRM)
   ```javascript
   {
     prospectId, promoterId,
     type, // 'call', 'email', 'text', 'ai_chat'
     notes, outcome, nextAction,
     aiSessionId, // If AI involved
     timestamp
   }
   ```

#### ChromaDB Collections:

1. **talk_fusion_knowledge**
   - Product information
   - Compensation plan details
   - Success stories
   - FAQs

2. **objection_handlers**
   - Common objections
   - Effective responses
   - Success rates

3. **ai_conversations**
   - Full conversation histories
   - Outcome tracking
   - Learning data

### Key Relationships to Model
1. **Sponsorship Line**: Who personally recruited whom (for bonuses)
2. **Placement Line**: Where they sit in binary tree (for volume)
3. **These are DIFFERENT** - Critical for proper tracking

### Deliverables Checklist
- [ ] Package.json with dependencies
- [ ] MongoDB connection module
- [ ] All 5 Mongoose schemas
- [ ] ChromaDB setup script
- [ ] Database indexes for performance
- [ ] Seed data script
- [ ] API documentation
- [ ] Integration guide for Elena
- [ ] Test suite
- [ ] README with setup instructions

### Integration Notes
- Elena (Backend API) will import your schemas
- Grace (AI) needs your ChromaDB collections
- Frank (Frontend) needs to understand data structure
- Create clean exports for easy importing

### First Session Tasks
1. Initialize npm project with required dependencies
2. Create MongoDB connection module
3. Build Promoter schema (most complex)
4. Test connection and schema
5. Save project state

### Dependencies to Install
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "mongoose": "^7.x",
    "chromadb": "^1.x",
    "dotenv": "^16.x",
    "joi": "^17.x"

### Remember
- You're building Kevin Gardner's proprietary system
- Magnificent Worldwide Marketing and Sales Group owns this
- Talk Fusion is just the external opportunity
- Focus on multi-tenant architecture from day one
- Save your progress frequently

**Start each session with**: "I'm David, Database Architect for Magnificent Worldwide. Loading project state to continue building Kevin Gardner's PowerLine database system..."

**End each session with**: "Saving progress on Magnificent Worldwide database. Current status: [summary]. Next session will continue with: [next task]."
